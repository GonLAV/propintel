# Planning Guide

A comprehensive real estate appraisal platform for professional appraisers with advanced 3D visualization, AI-powered analysis, floor plan design, investment forecasting, environmental quality assessment, advanced market comparison tools, and professional report generation - designed with a futuristic, minimalist interface inspired by Tesla and SpaceX product philosophy.

> **Competitive framing, corrected 2026-10-25 (agent-hq/competitive-analysis.md):** this document previously framed Simplex3D as a direct competitor to "surpass." Research against Simplex3D's actual site shows it's a different product category -- 3D real-estate marketing/visualization, not appraisal tooling -- so it isn't a meaningful appraisal-competitor benchmark, even though some of its visualization features are worth matching on their own merits (kept below, labeled by feature rather than by "beating" a non-competitor). The real direct competitors in the Israeli appraisal-tooling market, confirmed via live research, are **Quicker.co.il** (office/case management, ~8 years active, no published pricing or customer count), and two newer AI-first entrants, **Shama-AI** and **ShamayAI** (both extract data from ownership/permit documents and draft reports; Shama-AI publishes pricing at NIS 199-599/month). A non-AI office tool, **Omdan/Orion**, is closer to Quicker's positioning. See `agent-hq/competitive-analysis.md` for full sourcing and confidence levels on every claim.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Clean & Professional** - Light, minimalist interface with clear typography and well-organized content that feels professional and trustworthy
2. **Effortlessly Simple** - Complex functionality presented through clean design with intuitive navigation and clear visual hierarchy
3. **Focused & Efficient** - Data-rich displays with excellent readability, proper spacing, and visual feedback that enables quick decision-making

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality, likely with multiple views)
This is a professional tool requiring multiple sophisticated features: property database management, advanced AI-powered comparable property search and analysis with filtering/sorting/similarity scoring, automated valuation models, professional report generation with customizable sections, document management, client tracking, data visualization, 3D building visualization, sun/shade analysis, view quality analysis, floor plan designer with AI generation, investment forecasting with ROI analysis, environmental quality assessment, AR walkthrough mode with measurements/annotations/environmental sensors, collaborative AR sessions with real-time sync and group chat - all presented through an exceptionally polished, futuristic interface that makes complex tasks feel simple.
